# What's this? 

Here are some signed addons which are either too special, don't seem to have drawn enough attention on AMO or have some other drawback/issue for me to consider actively listing them. 

Still, since rarely someone ask for something that matches, I'll keep this repo as backup/reference. 

And maybe I'll re-add them to AMO if I think one of them might be worth it.
